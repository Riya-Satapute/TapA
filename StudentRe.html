                <td><pre> A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.
                    I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out 
             student. I joined Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month 
             of February. My journey with Tap Academy is quite different. 
             The trainers at Tap Academy are skilled and experienced. 
             They teach a lot of new concepts and help in learning 
             programming languages from scratch.
        
             I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at 
             Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for 
             students from all domains to understand the concepts and 
             technology taught by the trainers.
        
             Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a 
             package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in 
             securing this job.
        
             Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me 
             acquire this opportunity.

                        <pre>After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming 
                        skills, and my knowledge of core Java has also improved. 
                        Now, I am learning the Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, 
                        and CSS in parallel.

                        Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-
                        solving skills. Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all 
                        the recorded videos. They also provide recorded videos of 
                        frameworks like J2EE, Spring, Data Structures, etc.
                        
                        I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of 
                        Associate Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.

                        experience with Tap Academy. They visited our college in 
                        Tamil Nadu and selected students for their CSR batch, offering 
                        a free course that's been incredibly helpful. Compared to 
                        other academies, Tap Academy stands out for its excellent 
                        trainers, who explain complex concepts in a clear and concise 
                        manner, start from scratch, making it easy for beginners to 
                        understand, and provide in-depth coverage of programming 
                        and OOPS concepts, highly valuable for placement 
                        opportunities. I'm grateful to have been selected by Avasoft 
                        with the role of Trainee Engineer with a package of 5 LPA 
                        through college placement, and I attribute my success to Tap 
                        Academy's incredible teaching, as I used the same approach 
                        they taught me during them mock interview process. 
                        Additionally, Tap Academy offers comprehensive notebooks 
                        and study materials, an LMS platform with daily class 
                        recordings, a TAl platform for practicing daily programming
                        questions, weekly assessments, and monthly mock assessments
                        and Interviews, boosting placement confidence, as well as
